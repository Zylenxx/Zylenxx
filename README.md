Greetings. Im Zylenxx, formerly known as Centroid.
Im a 19 yo. producer from Germany who recently has (re-)started coding in GLUA within Gmod.


For now most Files you will see here will consist of things i have either coded in E2 or in GLUA itself.
Starfall projects will be out of question for now until i have a proper foot in GLUA itself.

Special notes:
• Use and refer to these files at your own caution. Some files are barely commented and yet need to be, and/or some files could potentially
  be in the way of functionality if irrational events may accur.
• My approaches may or may not be based on previous knowledge about restrictions. This may or may not be useful for those who have worked with 
  similar restrictions.
• For any questions i am always available to be added on discord:

Enjoy looking through my stuff!
